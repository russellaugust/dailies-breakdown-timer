# Dailies Breakdown Timer
This is a personal project to track the amount of time it takes to perform each step of a breakdown process for our film dailies. It's useful to track my progress and see if I'm getting faster or slower.

There's also a hope that I'll be able to improve my workflow so having these numbers will be useful for seeing if I'm actually saving any substantial time.
